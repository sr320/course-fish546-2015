# Workflow Notes

Will

* for final- leave out tunnel (user specific)
* make more generic (can make diff version as current one is helpful for you.)
* tip can use `\` for line breaks in code - makes easier to read.
* why not just embed screenshots?
* Graphs still need splitting out into 3 aspects
* Links at bottom broken
* Could simplyfy with categories 1) Blast - 2) Gene Ontology Info 3) Visualization.

Jake 

* Needs to be less narrative - narrative is for **Product**.
*  Workflow should be ipynb notebooks you link to with instructions, comments, and without personal commentary.
* Include a readme to indicate a series of notebooks
* Should be that persons could replicate your work - you can assume said persons can install software.
* Lose "Piecemeal" etc
